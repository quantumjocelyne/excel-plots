Excel-Files-Cleaner: A Data Processing and Visualization API

This repository contains the code for an API specifically designed to clean, sort, and process data extracted from Excel files which are related to a specific source,
namely data logger devices that capture and log temperature and relative humidity values over time. 
The API, paired with a dedicated data processing module called AFM.py, dynamically extracts, cleans and sorts the relevant data, performs necessary preprocessing, 
and subsequently visualizes the data plotting temperature and relative humidity against time.
Whether you're dealing with raw readings from the data logger devices or you're simply interested in how the data transformation works, this repository 
offers an idea for an end-to-end solution for handling such specific data
